Created this project as a means of working with Selenium\

Noticed there are a lot of extremely highly priced vintage items on men\'92s clothing site grailed, and a lot of cool, not too expensive vintage items on eBay, so I wanted to make this script to automatically convert a grailed listing to eBay\

Current issues I am troubleshooting:\
Getting eBay item description and size\
There are some inaccuracies with the color estimator due to background noise (I am planning on simply cropping the image)\
Grailed requires captcha to sign in, so I will need to figure out a way to bypass that}
